To install:

Add this line to GlobalSettings:
 Require_Once ($IP . '/extensions/SiteWideMessages/SiteWideMessages.php');

Also add new SQL table definitions and default messages to your *GLOBAL* database:
 mysql wikicities < /extensions/SiteWideMessages/~SQL

Keep in mind that there is an event called FirstMessageEdit which will send a message to each user after his first edit on Wikia _AFTER_ setting database table definitions.
To fix this problem you'll need to pretend all user has already received that message, therefor use this SQL on *GLOBAL* database:

INSERT IGNORE INTO `user_mssgstatus` SELECT `user_id`, `user_name`, '2', '3', UNIX_TIMESTAMP() FROM `user`;

[20.12.06] Also set hotfix for table `user_mssgstatus`: 
  ALTER TABLE `user_mssgstatus` ADD PRIMARY KEY (`user_id`, `user_ip`, `user_mssg_id`);
[21.12.06] Also set hotfix for tables `user_newtalk` on *LOCAL* db and `shared_newtalks` on *GLOBAL* db:
	ALTER TABLE `user_newtalk` CHANGE `user_ip` `user_ip` VARCHAR (255) ''; # OPTIONAL
	ALTER TABLE `shared_newtalks` ADD `sn_user_ip` VARCHAR (255) '' AFTER `sn_user_id`, ADD INDEX `sn_user_ip` (`sn_user_ip`);

If you want to disable this feature add to your LocalSettings:
  $wgDisableSiteWideMessages = True;
